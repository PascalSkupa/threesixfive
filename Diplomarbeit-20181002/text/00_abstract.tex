The 365 application generates a customizable meal plan for the whole year.
With the shopping list function all the ingredients that will be needed in the coming week are directly inserted into the shopping list.
The recipes are sorted by specific tags, such as vegetarian, high-protein or lactose-free. Allergens to a particular food can be specified and all recipes that contain it will be replaced. An extra function helps to plan the week more precisely. For example, it is possible to set up meat twice a week and fish once a week. All details and personal preferences can be set and stored in a private account.
